# Hello-World
This project is meant for those who wants to have a quickstart on **Python** language. Each *.py* file in this project will cover different basics of **Python** language; including *printing*, *lists*, *unpacking* etc. I'd try to add some *challenges* for the viewer to test himself/herself.

For a basic text-only game using the most basic concepts, visit [here](https://github.com/Muntaha-Islam0019/CERO "CERO").

Thank you for visiting here. Have a octotastic day!
